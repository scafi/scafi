/**
 * Specializes an [[it.unibo.scafi.distrib.actor.Platform]] into a "decentralized platform" where
 *   - Devices interacts directly with one another
 * Issues to be solved / Decisions to be taken:
 *   - How to handle "platform sensors" (e.g., NBR_RANGE)?
 *   - How a device can become acquainted with another device?
 * It seems that, despite the architecture name, some centralization is needed.
