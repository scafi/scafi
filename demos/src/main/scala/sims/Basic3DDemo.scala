/**
 * 3D version of BasicDemo.
 * To convert a 2D simulation to 3D: simply set Settings.Sim_3D to true. You can also use Settings.Movement_Activator_3D
 * to set a 3d movement, otherwise the 2d movement function will be used. Finally, Settings.Sim_3D_Reduce_Sparsity can
 * be set to false to disable the adjustment that avoids the sparsity increase when converting from 2d
 * to 3d. Leaving it to true lets the simulator increase Settings.Sim_NbrRadius.
 * Keys:
 *  - WASD, space and c to move
 *  - middle mouse button drag or left and right arrows to rotate,
 *  - left mouse button drag to select
 *  - right mouse drag or U, H, K, N to edit selection
 *  - plus and minus to change focus
 * Reduce window size if you need more FPS. This can be useful for screens with high resolutions.
