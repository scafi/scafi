   * A field-calculus "behaviour" inherits from this trait.

   * - foldhood is given a "universal quantification" semantics
   * - neighbour exposes whether we are in one such quantification
   * - mid is so foundational that we put it here
   *
   * A consequence is that we do not have field types,
   * only locals: so we integrate at best with Scala
